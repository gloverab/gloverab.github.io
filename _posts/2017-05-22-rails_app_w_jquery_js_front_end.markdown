Sweet.

Totally sweet.

Some of the moments that I had while implementing jQuery and Javascript into my Rails app were the moments I'd been waiting for all along. I was so happy to get comfortable appending, prepending, adding event listeners, manipulating the DOM, and finally really feeling like I had *control* over a website.

Working in the Rails/backend world really stretched my brain and sometimes got *super* frustrating, but was fairly rewarding when data started flowing through the app as intended.

Working with Javascript, jQuery, and other JS plugins blew that rewarding feeling away. Finally it felt like I had the power to create a *modern* website. I was no longer managing a database, I was displaying it. And not just displaying it -- controlling *how* it was displayed! This was fun. This was the tinkering I was waiting for. This was **cool.**

I can only imagine that whatever little dopamine boosts I'm getting from watching/playing with my Javascript in action will only be multiplied exponentially once I begin doing some work with React.
