Before I had started at Flat Iron/Learn.co, I had tried to learn a bit of Javascript on Codecademy. It was my first time experiencing variables, loops, iteration, strings, arrays and really any concepts related to coding. Some of it confused me quite a bit, and looking back after the past 5 months, it's actually kind of hard to understand why! Most of these things come to me like second nature now, thanks to a combination of learning and practice. However, coming off of Ruby and reentering the world of Javascript was a little bit of a corner to turn.

Learning Ruby through Flatiron reintroduced me to the basics of programming; reminding me that computers don't know anything unless we define it for them. Reentering the world of Javascript further enforced that. Even though Javascript is such a versatile language, it also serves a constant reminder of how *little* is built in in order for that versatility to exist! Javascript can be used in so many applications and situations *because* it's as abstract as it is, and this is something I had to constantly remind myself of.

An example of this that instantly comes to mind is return values. It takes a second (and maybe a couple face-palms) to re-realize that as soon as you `return` something in javascript, that action is *over*. Conversely, if you don't explicitly tell a function to `return` something, you won't get anything back! Ruby was a bit more lenient with these statements, kind of willy-nillyingly letting the user get away with shortcuts that JS isn't as forgiving with. I'm at once tripped up at the literal-ness, but also thankful for it! Why? It is genuinely a bit more readable. For a beginner like myself, this is kind of relieving! Want to see what a function is supposed to be giving back? **boom.** There's the return value, right in your face. Want to know why it's not giving anything back? **facepalm.** You didn't tell it to.

This literal approach is a double edged sword! Now after spenidng hours and hours practicing, learning, coding, and practicing, I can easily look back on my past self and genuinely feel like I've *come* somewhere with all of this. Abandoning JS for Ruby, then living in Ruby for a while, then *returning* to JS and now living in JS-- what a journey! I'm excited to find that I've actually rewired myself to identify issues, switch between the languages, and really feel comfortable with the strengths and weaknesses of both.
