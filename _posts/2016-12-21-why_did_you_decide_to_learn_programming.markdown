Let's start from the beginning.

For the last 2.4 decades of my life I've played music. Classical piano was engrained in me from an early age, I moved on to play saxophone throughout grade school, and picked up guitar and bass somewhere along the way. I've combined all of those talents over the years to create and be a part of a number of incredibly rewarding projects. Be it playing to a room semi-full of enthusiastic listeners or getting that tick of positive feedback from a stranger online, there's something uniquely rewarding about it. Bouncing out a final mix, clicking "upload," or simply saying "thank you so much for coming" before sharing an original set of music all send an unrivaled dopamine rush to the head, no matter how many people are listening (although it's always preferable if they are!).

Let's break down what's great about that scenario.

**Creation**. To create something is to live and breathe through it; to develop a simple idea or concept into a fully fleshed-out, interactive final product is to temporarily put yourself inside of something. The roadblocks, the head scratching, the problem-solving, the new ideas, left-turns, the unexpected delays. The editing, the complete and absolute sense of failure and the rebirth before finally-- the click. The instant when you realize a song conveys exactly what was in your head all those minutes (weeks? Years?) prior, and you're ready for someone to listen.

Whoa, dude. Take a step back. Are you a total douche?

Shit. You're right. The needless explanation above might have been a bit melodramatic. Bit seriously, being able to craft something on the computer is almost the exact same set of feelings! You struggle to learn a wholly new language, and if you stick with it you're able to create something that might one day move somebody. Of course, along the way you're tasked with projects that aren't *as* rewarding, and that's fine. Your goal is, at the end of the day, to create and share.

I decided to learn programming because the ideas in our minds can't materialize themselves. The instruments we develop, whether musical or computational, are what allow us commit those ideas to the world.
